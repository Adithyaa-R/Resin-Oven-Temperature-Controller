# Resin-Oven-Temperature-Controller (Work In Progress)
A simple adjustable temperature controller that uses a lightbulb inside a large clay pot to keep resin warm while curing.
Made to work with the following components-
- Digispark attiny85 board
- DHT-11 temp & humidity sensor
- 16x02 LCD module I2C
- Generic sugarcube relay module
- Incandescent light bulb

Made for my personal use, but can be applied to incubators, filament driers, ovens, etc.
